##  **Project Overview**
- Pewlett-Hackard needs to conduct an analysis to plan for, and determine which employees will be retiring in the near future. This is important because the company needs to be ready for this, especially if many are about to retire at once. We also need to develop a mentor initiative to train our new staff. 

- We've created our data based on birth dates ranging from 1952-1955 and hired dates from 1985-1988.

     Company data and its purpose
</p>

    1. Why are we analyzing this data?
    2. What is the goal and possible outcomes?
    3. What pieces of data can help build toward and obtain our goal(s)?


## **Results**
It was important starting out to create an ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) in order to easily visualize the relationship of the tables. It's very important to analyze the tables and understand what is in each, and how they can be related to one another to provoke and answer more questions.

### **Summary**

This analysis was interesting but I also thought the results were somewhat predictable, which can happen in data science. When students try to cheat and change their scores, they are not giving themselves F grades - They are probably giving themselves A and B grades. 

With this in mind, when we alter our data by taking out the 9th graders for a particular school, your overall passing scores will lower, because you are getting rid of the results of higher scores.

The budget per district and per school size will be altered as well as the new data is accounted for and calculated.
